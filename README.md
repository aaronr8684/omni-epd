EPD (electronic paper display) class abstractions for very slow media players

There are several implementations of very slow media players (VSMP), many in Python. The problem with a lot of these is that the code is often for one specific type of display, or perhaps a family of displays. This project abstracts the EPD classes into a common interface so a variety of displays can be interchangeably used in the same project. 

For VSMP project maintainers this expands the number of displays you can use for your project without having to code around each one. To utilize this in your VSMP project read the usage instructions. For a list of (known) projects that use this abstraction see the list below. 

## Install

## Usage

Usage in this case refers to VSMP project implementers that wish to abstract their EPD code with this library. 

## Displays Implemented
Below is a list of displays currently implemented in the library.
